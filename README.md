gemify.js
=========

A script to aid in the gemification of items.

Just copy paste the stuff into your JS console in the browser. And tada, press the 'Gemify Multiple' button, make your selections by clicking on the items and then press 'Gemify Selections' and it will gemify them and refresh your browser.


If anyone has any suggestions or would like to contribute, join me.


Note: This was written very hackily and under a short time span due to demand by a friend, please fix any crappily written code if you have spotted some and have the time. Thanks. :)
